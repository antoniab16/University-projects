# University-projects
  This is a repository of my university projects up to date. It tracks my progress throughout my studies at [Babeş-Bolyai University of Cluj Napoca, Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, Bachelor’s in Computer Science](https://www.cs.ubbcluj.ro/) .



## Semester 1
  - ### Fundamentals of programming
    - **Language used** : *Python*
    - **Description** : *Assignments about key programming concepts, introductory problem solving methods, concepts about design, implementation and maintanance of system, understanding of software                            tools and Python language*
## Semester 2
  - ### Object oriented programmig
    - **Language used** : *C++*
    - **Description** : *Assignments that solve small/medium scale problems using OOP, that construct and use class structures as fundamental, modular building blocks and also use Qt to build GUIs*
  - ### Data structures and algorithms
    - **Language used** : *C++*
    - **Description** : *Assignments that implement data structures and abstract data types so that we understand how they work and what their time and space complexity are.*
